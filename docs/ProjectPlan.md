# Project Plan

## 1 Introduction

The application is a Job Offer Comparison android application that compare different job offers with each other. These jobs can hold a variety of information such as the adjusted salary based on cost of living, benefits, location, etc. The application also provides rankings based on adjustable parameters of the jobs. The aim of the application is to provide the user with a simplified and easy to use UI for determining pros/cons of different job offers as they relate to their current job.

## 2 Process Description

### Requirements Analysis

#### Desicription
In order to accurately develop the application to meet the User's needs. The requirements must be clearly listed and understood with how they relate to the application. This activity is used in a lot of development models, but for this project plan it is a step in the waterfall development process.

#### Entrance Criteria
Requirements from the user, either in list form, an epic, or user stories.

#### Exit Criteria
Design-discussion document with accompying UML diagram, use case model document, extra requirements document

### Coding & Development

#### Desicription
Once the requirements have been understood and mapped to the application, technical development of the application can begin. The application will be developed using Android Studio. Depending on time constraints, project tasks can be created for each requirement which will then be coded. The code will be placed on a development branch of the project repository until it is ready to be released.

#### Entrance Criteria
Requirments documents, project tasks

#### Exit Criteria
Android Studio code pushed to the project repository development branch

### Code Review and Deployment

#### Desicription
This activity is to ensure that the code being used in the application is up to a suitable standard. This will lessen the chance of bugs and should save development time in the long run.

#### Entrance Criteria
Code pushed to the development repository

#### Exit Criteria
Code review passed: code is pushed to testing branch repository
Code review failed: comments are made on why code has failed, will be developed/fixed and the process will repeat until pass

### Testing

#### Description
The application will need to be tested to ensure the requirements are being met. This will be done in chunks or as soon as code portions have passed review. The exact testing plan is described more in detail in the TestPlan.md document.

#### Entrance Criteria
Code that has passed code review

#### Exit Criteria
Code is user tested and meets requirements

### Release

#### Desicription
The final step in the development plan is to release the code into the master branch, which in turn releases the code to the Users. Many releases can happen until the application has fully met requirements. Released code is meant to be fully reviewed and tested by the developers before releasing to users.

#### Entrance Criteria
Fully tested and reviewed code

#### Exit Criteria
Packaged functional Android application
